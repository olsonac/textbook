# Pandas plotting methods

We start by loading our [familiar gender_data dataset](../data/gender_stats).

```{python}
# Load the Numpy array library, call it 'np'
import numpy as np
# Load the Pandas data science library, call it 'pd'
import pandas as pd
# Turn on a setting to use Pandas more safely.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
```

If you are running on your laptop, you should download the
{download}`gender_stats_min.csv <../data/gender_stats_min.csv>` file to the same
directory as this notebook.

```{python}
# Load the data file
gender_data = pd.read_csv('gender_stats_min.csv')
gender_data.head()
```

```{python}
# Get the GDP values as a Pandas Series
gdp = gender_data['gdp_us_billion']
gdp.head()
```

## Plotting with methods

You have [already seen](data_frame_intro) basic plotting with the Matplotlib
library.

Here is the magic incantation to load the Matplotlib plotting library.

```{python}
# Load the library for plotting, name it 'plt'
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Make plots look a little more fancy
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
```

Here is basic plotting of a Pandas series, using Matplotlib.  This is what you have already seen.

```{python}
plt.hist(gdp);
```

It is possible you will see warnings as Matplotlib tried to calculate the bin
widths for the histogram.  If you do see them, these warnings result from
Matplotlib struggling with `NaN` ([missing](missing_values) values.


Another way to do the histogram, is to use the `hist` *method* of the series.

A method is a function attached to a value.  In this case `hist` is a function attached to a value of type `Series`.

Using the `hist` method instead of the `plt.hist` function can make the code a bit easier to read.  The method also has the advantage that it discards the `NaN` values, by default, so it does not generate the same warnings.

```{python}
gdp.hist();
```

Now we have had a look at the GDP values, we will look at the
values for the `mat_mort_ratio` column.  These are the numbers
of women who die in childbirth for every 100,000 births.

```{python}
mmr = gender_data['mat_mort_ratio']
mmr
```

```{python}
mmr.hist();
```

We are interested in the relationship of `gpp` and `mmr`.  Maybe richer countries have better health care, and fewer maternal deaths.

Here is a plot, using the standard Matplotlib `scatter`
function.

```{python}
plt.scatter(gdp, mmr);
```

We can do the same plot using the `plot.scatter` method on the data frame.  In that case, we specify the column names that should go on the x and the y axes.

```{python}
gender_data.plot.scatter('gdp_us_billion', 'mat_mort_ratio');
```

An advantage of doing it this way is that we get the column names on the x and y axes by default.
