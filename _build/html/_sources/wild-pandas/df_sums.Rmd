# Data frame, sums

This page is a short explanation of how to use sums across columns and rows in data frames.

It follows on from the [noble politics](noble_politics) page.


```{python}
# Our usual imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
# Safe setting for Pandas.  Needs Pandas version >= 1.5.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
```

As in the *noble politics* page, we load the table of counts from table 6.8 of:

> Samuel P. Oliner and Pearl M. Oliner (1992) "The Altruistic Personality:
> Rescuers of Jews in Nazi Europe". Free Press, New York. ISBN 0-02923829-3.

As usual, if you are running on your own computers, download the file
{download}`oliner_tab6_8a_1.csv <../data/oliner_tab6_8a_1.csv>` to the same directory as this notebook.

```{python}
# Load the table
party_tab = pd.read_csv('oliner_tab6_8a_1.csv')
party_tab
```

Next we follow the procedure in the noble politics page set the index and drop
the last (redundant) row, and a column we are not interested in.

```{python}
# Replace the numerical index with the party_yn labels.
party_tab = party_tab.set_index('party_yn')
# Select rows and columns of interest.
bystander_tab = party_tab.loc[['Yes', 'No'], ['rescuer', 'bystander']]
bystander_tab
```

Adding up the entries in the columns of the data frame, we see that there were
209 *rescuers* and 71 *bystanders*.

We can calculate these numbers by using the `.sum` method to get sum of the
values along the columns, and therefore, across rows.

```{python}
bystander_tab.sum()
```

We would like to get the sums along the rows. We have already seen that `sum`,
by default, gives the sum for each column.

Luckily Pandas has a method called `transpose` that flips the rows and columns of a data frame, like this:

```{python}
flipped_tab = bystander_tab.transpose()
flipped_tab
```

Now the rows have become columns, and we can get the sum of Yes and No with:

```{python}
flipped_tab.sum()
```

Or, all in one go:

```{python}
bystander_tab.transpose().sum()
```
