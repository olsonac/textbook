# Inserting values into strings

## f-strings

In [Brisk Python](./brisk_python.Rmd), we claimed that Python f-strings are
the usual best way to insert variable values into strings.

The example there was:

```{python}
shepherd_name = "Mary"
flock_size = 92
```

```{python}
f"Shepherd {shepherd_name} is on duty with {flock_size} sheep."
```

There are a couple of other ways you can do the same thing, that may be useful in particular circumstances.

## String format method

You can use the string method `format` method to create new strings with
inserted values. Here we insert a string into another string:

```{python}
"Shepherd {} is on duty.".format(shepherd_name)
```

The empty curly braces show where the inserted value should go.  `shepherd_name` is the argument to the `format` method, and tells Python which value to insert.

You can insert more than one value.  As for f-strings, the values do not have
to be strings, they can be numbers and other Python objects.

```{python}
"Shepherd {} is on duty with {} sheep.".format(shepherd_name, flock_size)
```

```{python}
"Here is a {} floating point number".format(3.33333)
```

You can do more complex formatting of numbers and strings using formatting
options within the curly brackets â€” `{` and `}`. See the documentation on
[curly brace string
formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-examples).

The same formatting rules apply to f-strings.

This system allows us to give formatting instructions for things like numbers,
by using a `:` inside the curly braces, followed by the formatting
instructions.  Here we ask to print in integer (`d`) where the number should
be prepended with `0` to fill up the field width of `3`:

```{python}
"Number {:03d} is here.".format(11)
```

This prints a floating point value (specified by the `f` after the `:` in the
string) with exactly `4` digits after the decimal point:

```{python}
'A formatted number - {:.4f}'.format(0.213)
```

See the Python string formatting documentation linked above for more details
and examples.

## % formatting

This is the oldest way of doing string interpolation, and you will rarely find a use for it.  Here you use the `%` operator to tell Python the values to put into the string.  Just for a quick example, to replicate the example at the top of the page, you could also use:

```{python}
"Shepherd %s is on duty with %d sheep." % (shepherd_name, flock_size)
```

The `%s` tells Python you want to insert the first value at that point, and it
should be treated as a string (the `s` in `%s`).  The `%d` tells Python the
second value should be treated as an integer.

As we've said, you'll rarely have need for this `%` syntax, but you will see it in older code, and rarely, in special cases for recent code.
