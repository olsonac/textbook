# Titanic passenger data set

See: <https://github.com/odsti/titanic>.

You will find versions of this dataset scattered around the interwebs, but the
file {download}`titanic_stlearn.csv` contains data for the passengers on the
Titanic, derived from a version of these data contained in the [Stablelearner
R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stablelearner).

See the ODSTI link above for a description of the various columns, and the
minimal processing we have done to the original data.

{download}`titanic_clean.csv` derives from `titanic_stlearn.csv`, but we have
dropped a small number of rows with missing values.
