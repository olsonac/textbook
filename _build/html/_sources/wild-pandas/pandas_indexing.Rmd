# Indexing in Pandas

<!---
Summary:

Simple indexing
Indirect indexing
   Labels with loc
   Positions with iloc
-->

Way back in the [basic row indexing](../data-frames/df_basic_row_indexing), we
showed row selection by indexing into data frames with *Boolean vectors*, such
as Pandas Series. We called this *direct indexing with Boolean Series* (DIBS).
We also covered selecting columns by [indexing into data frames with column
labels](../data-frames/df_basic_col_indexing).  We called this *direct indexing
with column labels* (DICL).


## Simple indexing and the golden rule

We will use the term *simple indexing* to cover both of DIBS and DICL.

**Simple Indexing**

> Direct indexing with either Boolean Series (DIBS) or column labels (DICL).

Here follow some examples.

We start with our usual imports:

```{python}
# Load the Numpy library, rename to "np"
import numpy as np

# Load the Pandas data science library, rename to "pd"
import pandas as pd

# Safe setting for Pandas.  Needs Pandas version >= 1.5.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
```

We return to a version of our first data frame, containing statistics on
development and gender from the World Bank.

This is the {download}`gender_stats.csv <../data/gender_stats.csv>` file.
See [the gender stats data
page](https://github.com/matthew-brett/datasets/tree/master/gender_stats) for
some more detail.

Download that file to the same directory as this notebook, if you are running
on your own computer.

```{python}
# Load the data file as a data frame.
gender_data = pd.read_csv('gender_stats.csv')

# Show the first 10 rows
gender_data.head(10)
```

### Direct Indexing with Column Labels (DICL)

Direct Indexing with Column Labels (DICL) happens when we do *direct indexing*
(square brackets immediately follow the data frame variable), where one or more
*column labels* go inside the square brackets.

For example, here we use DICL to get the values for one column as a Pandas Series:

```{python}
# DICL with a single column name
gender_data['mat_mort_ratio']
```

We can use more than one column label by putting the column labels in a list:

```{python}
# DICL with a two column names in a list.
cols_we_want = ['gdp_us_billion', 'mat_mort_ratio']
gender_data[cols_we_want]
```

```{python}
# DICL with a two column names in a list.
# Here we create the list inside the indexing brackets, instead
# of first creating it and storing it in a variable.
# Notice the two uses of square brackets - following "gender_data" to
# do indexing, and around the column labels to create a list.
gender_data[['gdp_us_billion', 'mat_mort_ratio']]
```

DICL gives a single column (Series) with a single label, or a subset of columns
(a new data frame) when we pass a list of column labels.

### Direct Indexing with Boolean Series (DIBS)

Direct Indexing with a Boolean Series (DIBS) happens when we put a Boolean
Series within the indexing brackets.

DIBS selects a subset of the *rows*.  Specifically, it selects the rows where the Boolean Series has True.  It returns a subset of the original dataframe.

For example, let us say we wanted to select the rows in the `gender_data` data frame where the `mat_mort_ratio` value was greater than 100.

We first create a Boolean Series, with True for rows where `mat_mort_ratio` is
greater than 100, and False otherwise.

```{python}
# DICL to get the mat_mort_ratio column as a Series.
mmr = gender_data['mat_mort_ratio']
# Make a Boolean Series with True for > 100, False otherwise.
mmr_gt_100 = mmr > 100
```

We index with the Boolean Series (DIBS), to select only those *rows* where `mat_mort_ratio` was greater than 100.  Notice that you get a data frame back.

```{python}
# DIBS
gender_data[mmr_gt_100]
```

Here we created the Boolean Series in two steps, and then used it to do the indexing.  It's more common to create the Boolean Series with an expression inside the indexing brackets:

```{python}
# DIBS, creating the BS with an expression inside the indexing brackets.
gender_data[gender_data['mat_mort_ratio'] > 100]
```

Notice that this is exactly the same as the indexing above; Python first sees
and evaluates the expression inside the square brackets:
`gender_data['mat_mort_ratio'] > 100`, to make the Boolean Series, and then
passes the resulting series to the data frame indexing machinery to select the
rows.

## Indirect indexing

The rest of this page covers more sophisticated indexing in Pandas - *indirect
indexing*.

Why don't we use the term *direct indexing* instead of *simple indexing*?
Because there are various other things you can put inside the square brackets
using direct indexing.  We won't go into other uses of direct indexing here,
because we strongly recommend that you restrict yourself to DIBS and DICL for
direct indexing â€” because other uses of direct indexing can quickly become
confusing and ambiguous, and because you can do all the indexing you need using
the indirect indexing techniques in this page.  As you will see, indirect
indexing uses the `.loc` and `.iloc`attributes of the DataFrame.

Here is the rule we propose.

**The Golden Rule of Pandas Indexing**

> Only use Boolean Series or column labels for direct indexing.  For any other
type of indexing, use indirect indexing with `.loc` and `.iloc`.

We do not just advocate this rule for beginners.  We (your humble authors) also
stick to this rule, not only in this textbook, but in our daily work.  By
sticking to this rule, you will avoid some nasty and confusing errors, and you
will find it easier to think clearly about indexing.

## Indirect indexing

To understand indirect indexing, we return to the [index of data frames and
Series](../data-frames/df_index).  The *index* contains the *row labels* for a
data frame or series.

We start with our usual imports:

```{python}
# Load the Numpy library, rename to "np"
import numpy as np

# Load the Pandas data science library, rename to "pd"
import pandas as pd

# Safe setting for Pandas.  Needs Pandas version >= 1.5.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
```

We return to a version of our first data frame, containing statistics on
development and gender from the World Bank.

This is the {download}`gender_stats.csv <../data/gender_stats.csv>` file.
See [the gender stats data
page](https://github.com/matthew-brett/datasets/tree/master/gender_stats) for
some more detail.

Download that file to the same directory as this notebook, if you are running
on your own computer.

```{python}
# Load the data file as a data frame.
gender_data = pd.read_csv('gender_stats.csv')

# Show the first 10 rows
gender_data.head(10)
```

As you know, the names at the top, in **bold typeface**, are the names of the
columns.  We can see these names using the `columns` attribute of the data
frame:

```{python}
gender_data.columns
```

These can also be called the *column labels*.

Here is a summary of the meaning of most of the columns:

* `fert_rate`: Fertility rate, total (births per woman).
* `gdp_us_billion`: GDP (in current US \$ billions).
* `health_exp_per_cap`: Health expenditure per capita, PPP (constant 2011
  international \$).
* `health_exp_pub`: Health expenditure, public (% of GDP).
* `prim_ed_girls`: Primary education, pupils (% female).
* `mat_mort_ratio`: Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000
  live births).
* `population`: Population, total (millions).

We have not paid attention so far to the numbers at the left of the table
display, also in bold typeface.

In this case, they are ascending integers, starting at 0, with value 0 for the
first row, 1 for the second row, and so on.

These numbers are the *index* of the data frame.  The index contains the *row
labels*.

We can see the row labels / index with the `index` attribute of the data frame.

```{python}
gender_data.index
```

This is saying we have a simple index, that is like a `np.arange`, starting at
0, and continuing in steps of 1 up to, but not including 216.

So far, the index looks like row numbers, with 0 for the first row, 1 for the
second row.  We will soon see that the index is more than that.


For example, let us look at the last 15 rows.  We can get these with the `tail`
method of the data frame.

```{python}
last_15 = gender_data.tail(15)
last_15
```

Here is the `index` of this new data frame.

```{python}
last_15.index
```

Notice that the first row of this new data frame no longer has the label 0 - it
has label 201.  These numbers are the labels from the original data frame, from
which we selected the rows.

Notice too that the second row in this table is the USA, and it has the label
\202.


Now imagine that I sort the original data frame by Gross Domestic Product, and
select the top 15 rows.  By doing this, I select the top 15 richest countries.

```{python}
# Sort by GDP.
df_by_gdp = gender_data.sort_values('gdp_us_billion', ascending=False)
# Take the top 15 rows.
richest_15 = df_by_gdp.head(15)
richest_15
```

Now notice that the index values have followed their respective rows.  The row
for the USA is now first, but it has kept its original index value (row label)
\- 202.  The index value *identifies* the row.

Here is the index for this small table:

```{python}
richest_15.index
```

Now let us say that I wanted to get the eleventh row of this table.

I would be tempted to do something like `richest_15[10]` - but then - what
would Pandas give me?   Does `10` mean the row label for "Australia"?  Or does
it mean the eleventh row of the table, as it would for an array, and therefore
the row for "Canada"?  That is, will the indexing using the *labels* (index
values)?  Or will it use the positions (as for indexing in Numpy arrays)?

The answer is, it is ambiguous, and when things are ambiguous, Pandas has to
guess.   That's a bad idea, because then we have to guess what Pandas has
guessed, and it is starting to get really confusing.

For that reason, we careful Pandas users do not index rows with code like
`richest_15[10]`.  When we are not using Booleans to select rows, we always use
one of the two indexing attributes that Pandas provides.  Each does a different
type of indexing.

* The `loc` (label locate) attribute indexes using the *labels* (row index).
* The `iloc` (position locate) attribute indexes using the positions.

Here they are in action:

```{python}
# Get the row with label 10
richest_15.loc[10]
```

```{python}
# Get the row at position / offset 10
richest_15.iloc[10]
```

In more details, what is happening in the first cell above is that
`richest_15.loc` gives us a special value (AKA *object*) that:

* knows about the `richest_15` data frame;
* will give us rows and columns, if we use `[ something ]` on it.

So, read `richest_15.loc[10]` as:

* Get the `richest_15` value (the data frame);
* Get the `loc` attribute of this data frame. This evaluates to a special
  object (value) that can give us rows and columns from the data frame, by
  looking at labels;
* Use this object to fetch the row labeled 10, by using indexing (`[10]`)


Likewise, read `richest_15.iloc[10]` as:

* Get the `richest_15` value (the data frame);
* Get the `iloc` attribute of this data frame. This evaluates to a special
  object (value) that can give us rows and columns from the data frame, by
  looking at positions (offsets);
* Use this object to fetch the row at offset 10, by using indexing (`[10]`).


When you select rows and columns from a data frame, consider carefully what you
want.

Do you want to select rows and columns by *label* (by *index*, in the rows).
Then you want `.loc`.

Do you want to select rows and columns by *position* (offset).  Then you want
`.iloc`.


## indexing and slices


`.loc` indexing gets you rows and columns by *label*.

One form of indexing you have seen for arrays, is labeling by *slice*, to get a
sequence of values.

A *slice* is an expression with a colon (`:`) in it somewhere.  Here's slice
indexing into an array:

```{python}
my_array = np.array(['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'])
# Give array of values from position 2 up to, not including position 4
my_array[2:4]
```

The same sort of indexing works using both `.iloc` and `.loc`.  For `.iloc`,
the parallel is obvious - because we specify positions in exactly the same way:

```{python}
# Rows from position 2, up to, not including, position 4
richest_15.iloc[2:4]
```

You can also do this kind of indexing with `.loc`, but it works differently.
To make this clear, let's start with `.loc` indexing where the row labels are
strings.  We set the row labels to be the country codes.

```{python}
richest_15_with_code = richest_15.set_index('country_code')
richest_15_with_code
```

As we would expect, we will get an error if we try to use numbers for `.loc`
row indexing, because `.loc` indexing only uses labels, and the labels are now
all strings:

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
richest_15_with_code.loc[2:4]
```

In fact we can use slices, but the value in front of the colon (if any) is the
*label* of the first row we want, and the value after the colon is the *label*
of the *last* row we want.

Notice that *this is different from position indexing* for arrays, or using
`.iloc`.  In those cases, the value after the colon gives the *stop* position.
We return values from positions up to *but not including* the stop position.
As a reminder:

```{python}
# From position 2 up to, but not including, position 4
richest_15_with_code.iloc[2:4]
```

Now consider this `.loc` indexing with a slice.  Here the value after the colon
is not a *stop* value, but an *end* label.  We *do* return the row
corresponding to the end label:

```{python}
# All countries starting at label 'JPN' and ending (including)
# row labeled 'FRA'
richest_15_with_code.loc['JPN':'FRA']
```

**For reflection** - why did Pandas choose to make label indexing work this
way?  Have a look at the example above.


## Loc and iloc indexing work on columns too


Consider this.  We use `.loc` and the label for the *row*, followed by the
label for the *column*.

```{python}
richest_15.loc[10, 'gdp_us_billion']
```

This selects the row *labeled* 10 (the USA row) and returns the value from the
`gdp_us_billion` column.

Conversely, `iloc` only understands positions, and so, integers.  It does not
understand or use labels:

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
# We can't specify columns by label, using iloc.
richest_15.iloc[10, 'gdp_us_billion']
```

Notice the somewhat informative error right at the bottom of the error message.


`iloc` can get columns by their position.  For example, `fertility_rate` is the
third column, and so we can get the fertility rate by asking `iloc` for the
eleventh row, third column, like so:

```{python}
richest_15.iloc[10, 2]
```

This is the value from the row at offset 10 and the column at offset 2.


## Series have an index too


Data frames have columns (and column labels), and rows (with row labels --- the
index).

Series also have element labels --- they also have an index.

Consider this column, of the fertility rates of the richest countries:

```{python}
# Get the fert_rate column from the data frame
rich_ferts = richest_15['fert_rate']
rich_ferts.head()
```

As y'all know, this is a Series:

```{python}
type(rich_ferts)
```

You probably also spotted the numbers to the left of the values.  Yes, the row
labels have come across from the data frame into the Series.  We can see that
the first element has row label 202, and we remember that this is the row label
(index value) for the USA.


As for the data frames, here is the index for the series:

```{python}
rich_ferts.index
```

Like data frames, we can index by label, with `loc`, and by position, with
`iloc`:

```{python}
# The value for row labeled 10 - Australia.
rich_ferts.loc[10]
```

```{python}
# The value for the row at position 10 - Canada
rich_ferts.iloc[10]
```

## Rows from data frames are Series


Here we select the row at position 0 (the first row):

```{python}
first_row = richest_15.iloc[0]
first_row
```

This is a Series:

```{python}
type(first_row)
```

Notice that the Series has 9 elements, one for each column in the data frame.

As you remember, we can see the number of rows and columns in a data frame
with:

```{python}
richest_15.shape
```

Remember, the columns have names, which we can also call *labels*.

When we select a row out of a data frame, we have one element per column, and
the labels for the columns now become the labels for the rows.

```{python}
first_row.index
```

As for any other Series, we can get elements by label, with `loc`:

```{python}
first_row.loc['fert_rate']
```

We can also get elements by position (offset), with `iloc`:

```{python}
first_row.iloc[0]
```

## You can index without loc and iloc, but please don't, except ...


In the pages following the [data frame
introduction](../data-frames/data_frame_intro), you saw that we can index into
data frame directly, using `[ something ]` after the data frame value, without
using `loc` or `iloc`.  Call this *direct indexing*.  This is a very reasonable
thing to do if:

* the `something` is a Boolean Series ([DIBS](../data-frames/df_basic_row_indexing)).
  This is not ambiguous.
* the `something` is a column label or list of labels
  ([DICL](../data-frames/df_basic_col_indexing)).  This isn't ambiguous either.

Both of these are entirely reasonable uses of direct indexing:

```{python}
# Direct indexing with a Boolean Series (DIBS).
# Select rows where 'health_exp_per_cap' is greater than 3000 dollars.
is_big_spender = richest_15['health_exp_per_cap'] > 3000  # Boolean Series
big_health_spenders = richest_15[is_big_spender]
big_health_spenders
```

```{python}
# Direct indexing with column labels (DICL).
# Select the 'country_code' column.
country_code = richest_15['country_code']
country_code
```

Those uses of direct indexing are entirely sensible.  Other uses of direct
indexing are not sensible, and we strongly encourage you not to use them.

For example, Pandas will also allow you to this, with the Series we just made:

```{python}
# Nooooooo !
country_code[10]
```

Please don't do that.  This is ambiguous.  Did you really mean the country with
label 10?  Or did you mean the country at position 10?   Pandas will guess for
you.  Don't let it.  If you are not selecting rows / elements with Booleans,
always do this:

```{python}
# By label
country_code.loc[10]
```

or this:

```{python}
# By position
country_code.iloc[10]
```

## You can use Boolean indexing with `.loc`


It is often convenient to use direct indexing with Booleans, as we have just seen:

```{python}
# Create a Boolean series with True for big spender rows, False otherwise.
is_big_spender = richest_15['health_exp_per_cap'] > 3000
is_big_spender
```

```{python}
# Direct Boolean indexing:
# Select rows where 'health_exp_per_cap' is greater than 3000 dollars.
big_health_spenders = richest_15[is_big_spender]
big_health_spenders
```

We can also use Booleans with `loc` indexing.  This allows us to do things such
as selecting rows with Booleans, and columns with labels, in one shot, like
this:

```{python}
# Boolean indexing for rows, with "loc"
# Get "country_name" column values for big health spenders:
big_spender_names = richest_15.loc[is_big_spender, 'country_name']
big_spender_names
```

In fact you can use some Boolean sequences with `iloc` as well, but that needs
[a little more explanation](../functions-conditionals/booleans_and_labels).
