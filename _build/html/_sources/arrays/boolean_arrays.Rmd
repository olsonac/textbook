# Boolean arrays

```{python}
# Import the array library
import numpy as np
# Make random number generator.
rng = np.random.default_rng()
```

We continue to improve on our implementation for solving the [three girls
problem](../code-basics/three_girls).

The [random choice](rng_choice) page gave us a way to simulate the four children of a family in one go:

```{python}
sexes = [0, 1]
children = rng.choice(sexes, size=4)
children
```

The next step is to get the count of girls from our four simulated children.   Because girls are 1 and boys are 0, we can do that with:

```{python}
# Add up the integers to count the number of girls.
count = np.sum(children)
count
```

Our interest in whether the `count` value is equal to 3. We can look at that
number and write down "Yes" if the number is equal to 3 and "No" otherwise, but
we would like the computer to do that routine work for us.  We use
[comparison](../data-types/Comparison):

```{python}
is_three = count == 3
is_three
```

True means our simulation found a family with three girls, and False means we
found a family some other number of girls.

In a while, we are going to simulate a very large number of these families, but
for now, let us simulate 5 families, in a somewhat laborious way:

```{python}
# Make an array to store the counts for each family.
counts = np.zeros(5)
# Make five families, store the counts.
family = rng.choice(sexes, size=4)
counts[0] = np.sum(family)
# Second family
family = rng.choice(sexes, size=4)
counts[1] = np.sum(family)
# Third
family = rng.choice(sexes, size=4)
counts[2] = np.sum(family)
# Fourth
family = rng.choice(sexes, size=4)
counts[3] = np.sum(family)
# Fifth.
family = rng.choice(sexes, size=4)
counts[4] = np.sum(family)
# Show the counts
counts
```

Each value in `counts` is the number of girls in one simulated family.

Now we have 5 numbers for which we want to ask the question - is this number
equal to 3?  We would like five corresponding True or False values.

Here is where arrays continue to work their magic - we can get this result with a single expression:

```{python}
are_three = counts == 3
are_three
```

`are_three` is an array with 5 elements, one for every element in the array we
compared, `counts`.

`are_three` is a *Boolean array* because it contains only Boolean (True, False) values.

We can see what kind of data the array contains by looking at the `dtype` attribute of the array.  Remember, an attribute is a value attached to another value. In this case it is a value attached to the `are_three` value.

```{python}
are_three.dtype
```

Each element in `are_three` has the result of the comparison for the
corresponding element.  The code above is equivalent to doing:

```{python}
# Make an array of Boolean type (the "dtype" argument)
are_three_longhand = np.zeros(5, dtype=bool)
# Do the comparisons one by one.
are_three_longhand[0] = counts[0] == 3
are_three_longhand[1] = counts[1] == 3
are_three_longhand[2] = counts[2] == 3
are_three_longhand[3] = counts[3] == 3
are_three_longhand[4] = counts[4] == 3
# Show the result
are_three_longhand
```

Now we want to know how many of the `counts` values are equal to 3.  This is
the same as asking how many True values there are in `are_three` (or
`are_three_longhand`.

We can do this using the `np.count_nonzero` function.  It accepts an array as its argument, and returns the number of non-zero values in the array.  It turns out that `np.count_nonzero` treats True as non-zero, and False as zero, so `np.count_nonzero` on a Boolean array counts the number of True values:

```{python}
my_booleans = np.array([True, False, True])
np.count_nonzero(my_booleans)
```

To see the number of times we found 3 in `counts`:

```{python}
np.count_nonzero(are_three)
```
