# Introduction to data frames


[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) is a Python package that implements *data
frames*, and functions that operate on data frames.

```{python}
# Load the Pandas data science library, call it 'pd'
import pandas as pd
# Turn on a setting to use Pandas more safely.
# We will discuss this setting later.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
```

We will also use the usual Numpy array library:

```{python}
# Load the Numpy array library, call it 'np'
import numpy as np
```

## Loading a data frame from a file

We start by loading data from a Comma Separated Value file (CSV
file).  If you are running on your laptop, you should download
the {download}`gender_stats_min.csv <../data/gender_stats_min.csv>`
file to the same directory as this notebook.

See the [gender statistics description page](../data/gender_stats) for more
detail on the dataset.

```{python}
# Load the data file
gender_data = pd.read_csv('gender_stats_min.csv')
```

This is our usual assignment statement. The Left Hand Side (LHS) is
`gender_data`, the variable name.  The RHS is an expression, that returns a
value.

What type of value does it return?

```{python}
type(gender_data)
```

This tells us that the `gender_data` value (or object) is of type `DataFrame`.
We can also see that that type is something that belongs to (is defined by) the
Pandas library.

As you can see, the DataFrame is a thing that contains a *table* of data.  The
table has rows and columns.

Pandas integrates with the Notebook, so, if you display a data frame in the
notebook, it does a nice display:

```{python}
gender_data
```

This default display for the DataFrame shows you the first five rows, then a
row of `...` and then the last five rows.  The row of `...` shows you that
there are more rows the display does not show between the first five and the
last five.

## What does the data mean?

In order to interpret these data, you need more information about what these
column names refer to.  This information is sometimes called the *data
dictionary*.  Here are the longer descriptions from the original data source
(link above):

* `gdp_us_billion`: GDP (in current US \$ billions).
* `mat_mort_ratio`: Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000
  live births).
* `population`: Population, total (millions).


## Missing values

Notice the `NaN` at the top of the GDP column.  This is a *missing value*.  We
will come to these in [missing values](missing_values).

For the moment, we will do something quick and dirty, which is to drop all the
missing values from the data frame.   *Be careful* - this is rarely the right
thing to do, without a lot of investigation as to why the values are missing.

```{python}
# Drop all missing values.  Be careful, this is rarely the right thing to do.
gender_data_no_na = gender_data.dropna()
gender_data_no_na
```

## Attributes

Like other Python objects (values), the DataFrame has *attributes*.

An *attribute* is some named *value* attached to another value.  You can think
of it as a *variable* attached to a value.  You can fetch the attached value
using the `<value>.<attribute_name>` syntax.  For example, one attribute of the
data frame, is the `shape`.  The `<value>` in our case is `gender_data_no_na`,
and the `<attribute_name>` is `shape`.

```{python}
gender_data_no_na.shape
```

Notice that the `.shape` attribute is a sequence of two values.  The first is
the number of *rows* and the second is the number of *columns*.

## Columns

As you would expect for a table, the DataFrame has columns, and the columns
have *labels*.   You can see the column labels in the display above, but you
can also get the column labels using the `.columns` attribute of the DataFrame.

```{python}
gender_data_no_na.columns
```

Notice from the display above, that Pandas wraps up the column names in their
own value, of type `Index`.

```{python}
type(gender_data_no_na.columns)
```

The `Index` type is Pandas way of storing a sequence of labels â€” in this case
column labels.

You can get the column labels (names) as strings by using `list` on the
`.columns`, like this:

```{python}
# Get column names from .columns attribute.
list(gender_data_no_na.columns)
```

In fact, there is a short-cut for doing that, which is to apply `list` to the
DataFrame itself.  In that case, the DataFrame interprets you to be asking for
the column names:

```{python}
# Get column names from DataFrame directly.
list(gender_data_no_na)
```
