# The DataFrame and the index

```{python}
# Load the Pandas data science library, call it 'pd'
import pandas as pd
# Turn on a setting to use Pandas more safely.
# We will discuss this setting later.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
```

In [introduction to data frames](data_frame_intro.Rmd), we introduced data frames, and looked at columns and column labels.

Here we load the same data from a file to give a DataFrame:

```{python}
# Original data frame before dropping missing values.
gender_data = pd.read_csv('gender_stats_min.csv')
# Show the result
gender_data
```

Again we see the rows and the columns.  In the last page we concentrated on the
DataFrame columns, the `.column` attribute, and the column labels. This time we
are going to concentrate on the rows.

## Row labels

The DataFrame has *rows*, and, in fact, the rows also have labels.

The row labels may not have been obvious from the display you have seen so far,
because the row labels are *numbers*, so it would have been easy to mistake the
row labels for row numbers.

You can see the row labels on the left hand side of the rows in the default
display, above.  For this default case, the *label* of the first row is 0, the
label of the second row is 1, and so on.


## Row labels are not the same as row numbers

By default, when you load a DataFrame, Pandas will give each row a label that
is a number, and that number is sequential by the order of the row in the file.
That means that, by default, the row label *will* correspond to the row
*position*. Here's the DataFrame we got from the default `pd.read_csv` load of
the data file:

```{python}
gender_data
```

Sure enough, the row at position 0 has label 0, the row at position 1 has label
1, and so on, all the way up to label 215 for the last (216th) row.  The row
labels happen to correspond to the row positions.

But in general, the row labels have no necessary relationship to the row
positions.  In fact, the row labels need not even be numbers.

You can see that the row labels need not correspond to position, when you drop
some rows as we did in the [data frame introduction
page](data_frame_intro.Rmd).

Let's drop the missing values again:

```{python}
gender_data_no_na = gender_data.dropna()
gender_data_no_na
```

We have now dropped the rows with label 0, 2 and 8, among others.  The first
row in the data frame (the row at position 0) now has label 1, the second row
(position 1) has label 2, and the fourth (position 3) has label 5.  The row
labels no longer correspond to the row positions.


## Row labels are in the `.index` attribute


In [introduction to data frames](data_frame_intro.Rmd), we found that
the Pandas houses the column labels in the `.columns` attribute of the
DataFrame.

You can get the labels for the rows with the `.index` attribute:

```{python}
gender_data_no_na.index
```

Notice that Pandas stores the row labels in an `Index`-type object (value),
just as it stored the column labels in an `Index` object (value).


Just as for the `.columns` object, you can get the row labels by applying
`list` to the `.index` attribute:

```{python}
# Make the row labels into a list.
row_labels = list(gender_data_no_na.index)
# Show the first 10 labels
row_labels[:10]
```

## Changing the row labels


As we said above, by default, the row labels are numbers, but they need not be
numbers â€” they could be strings.

Sometimes it is useful to change the default numeric row labels to something
more memorable to indicate the nature of the row.

For example, in our case, our rows correspond to countries.  We might want the
row label to remind us which country the row refers to.  There is a column,
`country_code` with a unique code for the country.   We can use those values to
replace the default numeric labels, using the `.set_index` method.

Remember, a *method* is a *function* attached to a value.  (Technically, it is
an *attribute* where the value of the attribute is a function).  We use `.set_index` by passing the column name of the column we want to use.

```{python}
labeled_gdata = gender_data_no_na.set_index('country_code')
labeled_gdata
```

Notice the new values to the left of the row are the corresponding country
codes, instead of the numeric labels we had before.  Notice too that Pandas
pulled the `country_code` column out of the DataFrame, to avoid duplication.
You can tell Pandas not to pull the column out of the DataFrame, by adding
`drop=False` to the argument for `set_index`.
