# Types of things


Every value in Python, has a type.

We can show what type of thing something is, by calling `type`, like this:

```{python}
type(1)
```

```{python}
a = 1
type(a)
```

If you get stuck in some code, it is often useful to check what the type of your values are.


We will use multiple types when analyzing data.  We cover some of the common ones, in this chapter.
