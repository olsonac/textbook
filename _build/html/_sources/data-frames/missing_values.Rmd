# Missing values

<!---
Expand here.
-->

```{python}
# Load the Numpy array library, call it 'np'
import numpy as np
# Load the Pandas data science library, call it 'pd'
import pandas as pd
# Turn on a setting to use Pandas more safely.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
```

If you are running on your laptop, you should download the
{download}`gender_stats_min.csv <../data/gender_stats_min.csv>` file to the same
directory as this notebook.

See the [gender statistics description page](../data/gender_stats) for more detail on the dataset.

```{python}
# Load the data file
gender_data = pd.read_csv('gender_stats_min.csv')
gender_data.head()
```

```{python}
# Get the GDP values as a Pandas Series
gdp = gender_data['gdp_us_billion']
gdp.head()
```

## Missing values and `NaN`

Looking at the values of `gdp` (and therefore, the values of the
`gdp_us_billion` column of `gender_data`, we see that some of the values are
`NaN`, which means Not a Number.  Pandas uses this marker to indicate values
that are not available, or *missing data*.

Numpy does not like to calculate with `NaN` values.  Here is Numpy trying to
calculate the median of the `gdp` values.

```{python}
np.median(gdp)
```

Notice the warning about an invalid value.

Numpy recognizes that one or more values are `NaN` and refuses to guess what to do, when calculating the median.


You saw from the shape above that `gender_data` has 216 rows.  We can use the
general Python `len` function, to see how many elements there are in `gdp`.

```{python}
len(gdp)
```

As expected, it has the same number of elements as there are rows in `gender_data`.

The `count` method of the series gives the number of values that are *not
missing* - that is - not `NaN`.

```{python}
gdp.count()
```
